# Dinner Planner
Coming up with meals is hard.

I've seen so many posts on social media and even experienced this in my household. We have recipes, we know what we like to eat, but we often forget things we can make, some times going months without making a certain meal.

So it's time to go shopping...what are we buying for? Ugh...wouldn't it be nice if someone just told us what we had to make for dinner?

Now there is!

Dinner Planner is a project I started to try and solve this problem and make meal planning less of a chore in my household.

Not only does it generate meals for the week, it also acts as a database for recipes you know.

Don't need the recipe? Just want to use a restaurant's name, or meal you know how to make by heart? No worries, there is an option to uncheck the recipe portion and just save the meal itself.

Don't feel like making one of the meals generated for you? Again, no sweat. Just click on the day of the week and replace the meal with one from your list!

If you have enough meals for seven days, the dinner planner won't ever plan the same meal twice for the week, unless specifically told to use leftovers.
